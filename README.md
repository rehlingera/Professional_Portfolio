# Professional_Portfolio

GOAL: Design something crisp and sleek, that immediately leaves an impression of good, clean work and tasteful design. Google Materialize will be the main library that will be used for the project. A logo will need to be designed for this webpage. It will be fully mobile responsive.

Structure

Main Page

The main landing page will use the parallax effect, with pictures of myself, maybe doing work. It will feature a navigation header bar. It will use the footer included in the library. The colors of the page will be airy, pastel.

Portfolio Page

The portfolio page will use a the built-in carousel. Each slide will be a custom-made logo or image card representing the work it will link to. Try to include a stripped-down version of Rehability with no identifying information attached to it. It can be marketed as a mobile solution for the human services industry.

Resume Page

Simple page featuring a clean, nicely formatted on-screen resume. Consider including drop-downs on some features to clear the less important clutter out of the way. Include the option to print a PDF.

Contact Page

A simple floating card with an email message sender. Connect it to a back-end service so that it's fully functional.
